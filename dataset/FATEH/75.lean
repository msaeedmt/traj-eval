Suppose \( A \) and \( B \) are commutative rings containing a field \( k \), with \( B \)
finitely generated over \( k \) as a ring. If \( \varphi : A \to B \) is a ring homomorphism with
\( \varphi|_k = \text{Id} \) and if \( Q \subset B \) is a maximal ideal, prove that \( \varphi^{-1}
(Q) \subset A \) is a maximal ideal.
