Let \( A \) be a domain and \( K \) its field of fractions.
\( x \in K \) is called almost integral if there exists an element \( r\in A, r \ne 0 \)
such that \( rx^n \in A \) for all \( n \ge 0 \).

  ∃ r : A, r ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ n : ℕ, ∃ y : A, r • (x ^ n) = algebraMap A (FractionRing A) y

\( A \) is called \textit{completely integrally closed} if every almost integral element
of \( K \) is contained in \( A \).

Let \( A \) be a domain. Show that if \( A \) is completely integrally closed, so is \( A[X] \).
