Let $S$ be a set having an operation $*$ which assigns an element $a * b$ of $S$ for any
$a, b \in S$. Let us assume that the following two rules hold:

1. If $a, b$ are any objects in $S$, then $a * b=a$.

2. If $a, b$ are any objects in $S$, then $a * b=b * a$.

Show that $S$ can have at most one object.
