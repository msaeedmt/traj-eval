Suppose that $R$ is a commutative ring with identity. For a subset $S$ of $R$,
let $\operatorname{Span}(S)$ be the minimal ideal containing elements in $S$. Prove that
$\operatorname{Span}(S)=\left\{\sum_{s\in S'}r_ss|S'\text{ is a finite subset of }S,r_s\in R\
\forall s\in S'\right\}.$
In other words, prove that the latter one is an ideal and any ideal containing $S$
also contains the right-hand-side.
